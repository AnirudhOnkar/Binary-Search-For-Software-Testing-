# Binary-Search-For-Software-Testing-
A simple implementation of the binary search algorithm in Python.

## Implementation Details

- **Input**: The algorithm accepts a sorted list of integers and a key to search for within the list.
- **Output**: The algorithm returns the position of the key in the list if it is found, otherwise, it indicates that the key is not present in the list.
